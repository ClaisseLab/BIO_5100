title: "Convert .qmd Quarto file to .R Script"
---

*If your adviser wants you to send them your code in a .R Script, but you originally wrote it in a .qmd file...*

-   this process removes the text parts of the .qmd, just keeps code and comments within all code chunks

1.  Open RStudio by double clicking on your .qmd file (which auto sets the working directory to that folder)

2.  Close just .qmd file (leave RStudio open)

-   Or you could open RStudio and manually set the working directory the folder where .qmd file is (RStudio \> Session \> Set working directory)

3.  Run code below in Rstudio console (but edit `file_name.qmd` to match your .qmd file name):

`knitr::purl("file_name.qmd")`

This will save a new .R script file in that folder that is just the code from your .qmd file

(.Rmd works same way as .qmd)
