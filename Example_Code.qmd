Week 2-3 Visualize distributions & descriptive statistics (NOTE: *link to this example code will be made available prior to associated assignment*)

[Week 4-5 Scatterplots, correlation, linear models (simple linear regression)](https://claisselab.github.io/BIO_5100/Scatterplots_cor_lm_regression.html)

[Week 7 Linear model to compare means, 2 independent samples and paired data](https://claisselab.github.io/BIO_5100/Compare_means_independent_paried_samples.html)

[Week 10 Linear model to compare multiple means, make pairwise comparisons (*and run a one-way ANOVA if you must*)](https://claisselab.github.io/BIO_5100/Compare_multiple_means.html)

[Week 13 Inference from a linear model w/ 1 numeric explanatory variable (Simple Linear Regression) + correlation significance tests & assumptions checking](https://claisselab.github.io/BIO_5100/Correlation_Regression_Inference.html)
