Walker\n\n(Primary text we follow for BIO 5100/L) Takes a statistical modeling approach, focusing on estimates of effects and uncertainty instead of traditional hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\nFundamentals of Data Visualization (using R) by Claus O. Wilke\n\nA guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. \nThe R code for the book can be found on GitHub, at https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz\n\n\n\nR for Data Science (2nd Edition) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund\n\nMostly covers details of using the tidyverse to import, wrangle and get your data ready to analyze. \n\n\n\nAnalysis of community ecology data in R by David Zelený\n\nMultivariate analysis including ordination (e.g., PCA, nMDS plots), cluster analysis and diversity analysis\n\n\n\nApplied Biostats by Yaniv Brandvain\n\nA “book” written to accompany his biostats course, lots of good guidance and resources.\n\n\n\nStatistical Thinking for the 21st Century by Russell A. Poldrack\n\nModern approach to introductory statistics, good sections on plotting and summarizing data.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel & Johanna Hardin\n\nModern take on introductory statistics in an R based format.\n\n\n\nModern Statistics for Modern Biology by Susan Holmes, Wolfgang Huber\n\nCovers many modern approaches to data analysis, and many different types of data including RNA-Seq, flow-cytometry, taxa abundances, imaging data and single cell measurements.\nNote some of the R code relies on Base R instead of Tidyverse functions.\n\n\n\nBeyond Multiple Linear Regression: Generalized Linear Models and Multilevel Models By Julie Legler and Paul Roback\n\nMore advanced stats topics including Generalized Linear Models likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping\n\n\n\nBiological Statistics by John H. McDonald\n\nTraditional statistics text, covering details of specific hypothesis tests (not R based, but potentially useful if your adviser makes you to use old school statistics)\n\n\n\nThe Big Book of R (links to online textbooks)\n\nA maintained list of of online R textbook resources"
